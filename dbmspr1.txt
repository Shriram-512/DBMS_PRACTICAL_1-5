Practical No. 1:  

Create a db called company consist of the following tables. 
1.Emp (eno,ename, job,hiredate,salary,commission,deptno,) 
2.dept(deptno,deptname,location) 
eno is primary key in emp 
deptno is primary key in dept

SQL Queries: 

CREATE DATABASE company;

USE company;

CREATE TABLE Emp(eno INT AUTO_INCREMENT, ename VARCHAR(30), job VARCHAR(20), hiredate DATE, salary INT, commission INT, deptno INT, PRIMARY KEY (eno));

CREATE TABLE dept(deptno INT, deptname VARCHAR(30), location VARCHAR(20), PRIMARY KEY (deptno));

INSERT INTO Emp(eno, ename, job, hiredate, salary, commission, deptno)
VALUES(1, 'Shriram', 'Manager', '1969-02-25', 80000, 7, 10),
(2, 'Krishna', 'Manager', '1999-05-27', 110000, 5, 20),
(3, 'Sanket', 'Clerk', '1979-06-14', 55000, 8, 30 ),
(4, 'Aniket', 'Salesman', '2001-08-07', 69000, 9, 20), 
(5, 'Kisna', 'Analyst', '2000-06-12', 120000, 6, 10);
       
INSERT INTO dept (deptno, deptname, location)
VALUES(10, 'Dev', 'Tokyo'),
(20, 'Marketing', 'Nairobi'),
(30, 'Sales', 'Helsinki'),
(40, 'Hr', 'Denver');

Solve Queries by SQL :

1. List the maximum salary paid to salesman

SELECT MAX(salary)  FROM Emp WHERE job = 'Salesman';

2. List name of emp whose name start with ‘I’

SELECT ename FROM Emp  WHERE ename LIKE 'I%' ;

3. List details of emp who have joined before ’30-sept-81’

SELECT * FROM Emp WHERE hiredate<('1991-09-30');

4. List the emp details in the descending order of their basic salary

SELECT * FROM Emp ORDER BY salary DESC;


5. List of no. of emp & avg salary for emp in the dept no ‘20’

SELECT count(*), avg(salary) From Emp Where deptno = 20;

6. List the avg salary, minimum salary of the emp hiredatewise for dept no ‘10’.

//Doubt : SELECT AVG(salary),Min(salary) FROM Emp WHERE deptno = 10;

7. List emp name and its department

SELECT e.ename,d.deptname FROM Emp e, dept d WHERE e.deptno = d.deptno;

8. List total salary paid to each department

SELECT e.salary, d.deptname FROM Emp e, dept d WHERE e.deptno = d.deptno;

9. List details of employee working in ‘Dev’ department

SELECT * FROM Emp WHERE deptno IN 
(SELECT deptno FROM dept WHERE deptname = 'Dev') ;

10. Update salary of all employees in deptno 10 by 5 %.

UPDATE Emp SET salary  = (select salary+(select salary*.5))
WHERE deptno = 10;
